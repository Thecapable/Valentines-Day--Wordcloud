# Valentines-Day--Wordcloud
A Wordcloud visualization made in Python for programmers to celebrate Valentine's Day

It's Valentine's month and I thought why not make something for our programming community that they can use to celebrate Valentine's Day. I have been very fascinated by the concept of word clouds since the first time I saw one and thought about what goes into making a word cloud. Being a pythonista, I searched the web for ways I can make my own word cloud, though there are various tools available on the internet which can help you generate beautiful word clouds. Unsurprisingly the library that helps make wordclouds in python goes by the name -**word cloud**!!.

# Concept
So the concept is very simple: I'm going to make a word cloud which would be in shape of a heart and would contain different words from different languages that mean - **LOVE**. Its quite easy to get such words from internet. Most of the words used by me are from Bollywood Songs as they are very common in those songs.

# Procedure
* First you need to either download or find a link to a png image of the heart shape. For reference, you can use- http://www.clker.com/cliparts/3/d/9/1/11949847661568287344heart_jon_phillips_01.svg.med.png 
* Make sure to install the library **wordcloud** using following command in cmd:
```
  pip install wordcloud
```
* Next, you need to open the **Valentine.py** and understand the code before running it. Refer to the comments within the code for it. 
* Run **Valentine.py** file.
